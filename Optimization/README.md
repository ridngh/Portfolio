**🚴‍♂️ Optimizing NYC Bike Lanes with Citi Bike Data**  
How should a city decide where to build its first bike lanes? Our team tackled this question using Citi Bike ride data from 2023, aiming to maximize demand coverage and interconnectivity while staying within budget, drawing inspiration from [Urban Bike Lane Planning with Bike Trajectories: Models, Algorithms, and a Real-World Case Study](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2021.1023).
